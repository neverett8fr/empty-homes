# Empty Homes  

NOT YET READY TO USE
  
## Some stats
Hey there, good to see you!  
Here's some rather depressing information: 
- In October 2022, there were 676,304 recorded empty homes in England.  
- 248,149 were classed as ‘long-term vacant’ properties (vacant for more than six months with some exceptions).

And a little more:  
- At least 309,000 people homeless in England today [Posted 14 Dec 2023]  
- New research from Shelter shows at least 309,000 people in England [are homeless]  
- including almost 140,000 children

## But what is this?  
this is a work in progress application to show all the properties in the UK currently sitting empty, it relies on public reporting so not all the information will be accurate.  

Homelessness is something I care deeply about; but more than that, I believe that all these homes sitting empty while there are so many homeless people shows just how much we are failing at building a better world.  
My aim for this little website is to bring attention to the homes that sit empty so people can petition their governments through _proper_ means to do what they were elected to do.  

On a personal level, I think that squatting in empty, abandoned and safe homes is morally correct - but don't do it or the government will get angry.  
- Squatting in residential buildings (like a house or flat) is illegal. It can lead to 6 months in prison, a £5,000 fine or both.
